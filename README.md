### Hi there, stranger! Bold of you to come here.. My name is Jeff, a Data and Statistical analyst and R, SQL & Python brogrammer. ğŸ‘‹ 
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on refining my football analytics skills as I have a lot of passion and interest in the game and want to enter the field professionally.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about a team in football and we will spend the next like 3 hours debating tactics.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Scala & Julia atm.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™d be more than happy to collaborate on R, SQL and python projects (if they're interesting projects).
- ğŸ“« You can reach me here on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreyohene/)
- ğŸ’¬ I am also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeffrstats)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a Dobermann Pinscher enthusiast and Real Madrid & Arsenal fan.
- I speak English | Je parle franÃ§ais | Ich spreche sehr gutes Deutsch | Eu falo um pouco de portugues tambem
